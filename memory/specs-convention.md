# Specifications & Status Reports Convention

All specs go in **project root** `specs/` folder.

## Naming

- **Folders:** `XX-feature-name` (two-digit sequence, lowercase-hyphenated)
- **Files:** `XX-YY-description.md` (XX = folder number, YY = file sequence)
- Sequence numbers are unique per repository

## Example
```
specs/
    01-initial/
    05-async/
    12-screenshots-r2/
        12-01-backend-implementation.md
        12-02-setup-instructions.md
        12-03-troubleshooting.md
```

## When to Create Specs

New features, major changes, architecture decisions.
